    "Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What are the top 10 most enrolled courses, and what subjects do they cover?\n",
    "-   Which subject areas have the highest average enrollment but the fewest course offerings?\n",
    "-   Are there any difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) that are underrepresented in popular subject areas?\n",
    "-   Which specializations have the highest enrollment-to-course ratio, potentially indicating demand for more courses in that area?\n",
    "-   What are the emerging trends in course topics based on recent additions to the catalog?\n",
    "-   Are there any high-rated courses with relatively low enrollment, suggesting potential for growth with better marketing?\n",
    "-   Which languages, other than English, show high demand but have limited course offerings?\n",
    "-   Are there any gaps in the difficulty progression (Beginner to Advanced) within popular subject areas?\n",
    "-   What subject areas have the highest ratings but fewer course options compared to other subjects?\n",
    "-   Are there any in-demand skills or technologies that are underrepresented in the current course offerings?\n",
    "-   Which organizations have the highest-rated courses, and are there subject areas they're not covering?\n",
    "-   What is the distribution of course types (individual courses, specializations, professional certificates) across different subjects, and are there imbalances?\n",
    "-   Are there any correlations between course characteristics (e.g., duration, difficulty) and enrollment that could inform new course design?\n",
    "-   What topics are covered in the courses with the highest enrollment-to-rating ratio?\n",
    "-   Are there any subject areas with high enrollment but lower average ratings, indicating a need for improved course quality?\n",
    "-   What are the most common prerequisites for advanced courses, and are there gaps in preparing students for these?\n",
    "-   Are there any successful course formats or structures that could be applied to other subject areas?\n",
    "-   What is the distribution of course durations, and is there a sweet spot that could inform new course development?\n",
    "-   Are there any interdisciplinary topics that are currently underrepresented in the course catalog?\n",
    "-   What skills or knowledge areas are frequently mentioned in course descriptions of popular courses but don't have dedicated courses?\n"
